# yttrium
Web development micro-framework using raw CSS & JavaScript
- Contains only the most essential CSS for a mobile-first design
  - Unopinionated design, doesn't force any stylization

### ToDo
- Implement many common frontend tasks while being JQuery-free
  - MVC tasks may use MithrilJS, though focus on using raw JavaScript
  - Long-term target of implementing the vital pieces of Bootstrap, Foundation, etc
